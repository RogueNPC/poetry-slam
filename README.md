# poetry-slam
 
Welcome to Poetry Slam, where you can print out Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll in multiple different ways.  By reading a poem in new ways, we can discover new meanings or invite new interpretations.

This program can read poems normally, backwards, randomly, and in a special custom way:
Normally - The program prints the poem back completely with added line numbers
Backwards - The program prints the poem in reverse with the last lines first and the first lines last (comes with reverse line numbers)
Randomly - The program prints the poem with the lines switched out for other random lines within the poem, for example, what is on line 1 could be line 23 and line 2 could be line 5, etc.
Custom - The program prints the poem normally with randomly occuring joke lines in between lines of the poem

This project was coded using Python 3.7.9.
